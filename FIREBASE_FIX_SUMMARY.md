# Firebase 400 Bad Request Error Fix

## Problem
The application was experiencing 400 Bad Request errors when trying to write to and read from Firestore. This was occurring in the VendorForm component when trying to add a new vendor and when trying to retrieve vendor data.

## Root Causes
1. Firebase initialization issues - Firebase services were not being properly initialized with the correct app instance
2. Storage bucket configuration was incorrect - using `.firebasestorage.app` instead of `.appspot.com`
3. Improper error handling in Firebase service initialization
4. Multiple Firebase app instances being created
5. Issues with Firestore persistence and connection management

## Fixes Implemented

### 1. Firebase Client Initialization
- Added proper TypeScript types for Firebase objects
- Fixed storage bucket URL format
- Improved error handling throughout initialization
- Added check for existing Firebase apps to prevent duplicate initialization
- Ensured each service (Auth, Firestore, Storage) uses the same Firebase app instance
- Added proper Firestore persistence configuration with fallback options
- Added type safety throughout the Firebase initialization process

### 2. VendorForm Component
- Updated to pass the Firebase app instance to Auth and Firestore services
- Added support for Firebase emulators in development mode
- Improved error handling for Firebase operations
- Added retry logic for Firestore operations
- Used `setDoc` with a specific ID instead of `addDoc` for more reliable vendor creation
- Added timestamps for better data tracking
- Enhanced error handling with more specific error messages

## How to Test
1. Restart your development server
2. Try adding a new vendor through the admin interface
3. The 400 Bad Request errors should no longer appear
4. Check that vendors are properly displayed in the admin interface

## Additional Recommendations
1. Create a `.env.local` file in your project root with your Firebase configuration:
```


2. For local development with emulators, add:
```
NEXT_PUBLIC_USE_FIREBASE_EMULATORS=true
```

3. Consider implementing Firebase security rules to ensure proper access control:
```
rules_version = '2';
service cloud.firestore {
  match /databases/{database}/documents {
    // Allow admin users to read and write all documents
    match /{document=**} {
      allow read, write: if request.auth != null && get(/databases/$(database)/documents/users/$(request.auth.uid)).data.role == 'admin';
    }
    
    // Allow vendors to read and write their own documents
    match /vendors/{vendorId} {
      allow read, write: if request.auth != null && (
        request.auth.uid == resource.data.uid || 
        get(/databases/$(database)/documents/users/$(request.auth.uid)).data.role == 'admin'
      );
    }
  }
}
```

# Firebase Authentication Fix Summary

## Issues Fixed

1. **Session Cookie Management**
   - Added proper SameSite attribute to cookies
   - Improved session cookie setting with better error handling
   - Added logging for cookie operations to aid debugging

2. **Vendor ID Handling**
   - Fixed issue with vendor ID inconsistency between auth and Firestore
   - Ensured proper tracking of vendor ID throughout the authentication flow
   - Added fallback mechanisms for retrieving vendor data

3. **Redirection Logic**
   - Added small delay before redirection to ensure cookies are set
   - Simplified redirection code to use a single approach
   - Added better error handling for navigation failures

4. **Debugging Tools**
   - Created a dedicated auth-check page for troubleshooting
   - Added a login debug component to show authentication state
   - Added comprehensive session information display

## Key Changes

### Cookie Management
- Updated `setCookie` function to use SameSite=Lax for better security
- Added validation to prevent setting empty session cookies
- Added more verbose logging for cookie operations

### Authentication Flow
- Improved vendor lookup logic to handle different ID formats
- Added proper tracking of vendor ID throughout the authentication process
- Fixed session cookie setting to use the correct vendor ID

### UI and Navigation
- Simplified the login page's redirection logic
- Added debugging components to help troubleshoot issues
- Created a dedicated auth-check page for verification

## Testing
To verify the fix:
1. Try logging in with a test account in development mode
2. Check that session cookies are properly set (use the auth-check page)
3. Verify redirection to the dashboard works correctly
4. Test with real vendor accounts in production

## Next Steps
- Consider implementing server-side session validation
- Add refresh token handling for longer sessions
- Improve error messages for authentication failures
